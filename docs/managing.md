# How to Manage a Repository (This page is being updated)

After getting your code to your repo, you have a responsibility to manage it. Here are the tasks that you may need to perform at times.

## Code Management

### Step 1: Branch Management

You may need to create a new branch. Here is how to do that.
1. Create a new branch for feature development or bug fixes:
    ```bash
    git checkout -b <branch-name>
    ```
2. Push the new branch to GitHub:
    ```bash
    git push origin <branch-name>
    ```

### Step 2: Pull Requests
Sometimes, you may need to do the following:
1. Create a new Pull Request (PR) from GitHub interface.
2. Review the PR, and resolve any conflicts or issues.

### Step 3: Code Reviews
This includes:
1. Comment on code lines for any improvements or corrections.
2. Approve or request changes on the PR.

### Step 4: Version Control

1. Tag a commit to create a new release version:
    ```bash
    git tag <version-number>
    git push origin --tags
    ```

### Step 5: Conflict Resolution
This includes the following:
1. Fetch the latest changes from the remote repository:
    ```bash
    git fetch origin
    ```
2. Merge changes and resolve conflicts manually, then commit.

### Step 6: Automation

1. Setup CI/CD pipelines via GitHub Actions or external services.
2. Monitor build and test statuses for PRs and merges.


## Documentation

### README File

- Make sure to maintain an updated `README.md` that outlines:
  - Project purpose
  - Setup instructions
  - How to contribute

A template is provided [here](/templates/README.md).

### Wiki or Detailed Documentation
If you have documentation, utilize the GitHub Wiki feature or add a `/docs` folder for detailed documentation.

### Code Comments

- Document your codebase with inline comments and docstrings for functions/methods.

Example:

```python
def add_numbers(a, b):
    """
    Add two numbers together
    """
    return a + b
```

### Additional Documentation

- Include any additional `.md` files for FAQs, troubleshooting, etc.
- Use relative links to navigate between documentation files.

Example:

```markdown
[FAQ](./FAQ.md)
```

## Issue Tracking: Quick Guide

### Introduction

Issue tracking is a crucial part of managing a GitHub repository. Here, your responsibilities are to keep an eye on the problems, enhancements, tasks, and other kinds of questions that are meant for discussion.

### Tasks Involved

The tasks involved include:

#### 1. Creating Issues

- Anyone can create an issue in a public repository, but in a private repository, only collaborators can do this.
  
```bash
# Navigate to 'Issues' tab and click 'New Issue'
```

#### 2. Labeling Issues

- Use labels to categorize issues. Predefined labels include 'bug', 'enhancement', and 'documentation', among others.

```bash
# Click on an issue, then click on the 'Labels' button to assign labels
```

#### 3. Assigning Issues

- Assign issues to appropriate team members for actioning.

```bash
# Click on an issue, then click on the 'Assignees' button to assign team members
```

#### 4. Setting Milestones

- Milestones help in tracking the progress of multiple issues or pull requests.

```bash
# Click on an issue, then click on the 'Milestones' button to set a milestone
```

#### 5. Closing Issues

- Once resolved, issues should be closed to indicate that they require no further action.

```bash
# Click on an issue, then click on the 'Close Issue' button
```

## Community and Collaboration

### Code of Conduct

Here, your responsibilities are to set the rules and guidelines for community behavior. This helps in fostering a welcoming and inclusive environment.

- **Task Involved**: Create a `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` file outlining the expectations, rules, and consequences.

### Contributing Guidelines

In this section, your tasks involve outlining the process for contributions from external members.

- **Tasks Involved**: Add a `CONTRIBUTING.md` file that details steps for submitting pull requests, reporting bugs, and asking questions.

### User Support

Here, your responsibilities are to manage community interactions, be it questions, concerns, or suggestions.

- **Tasks Involved**: Monitor GitHub Issues and Discussions for community interactions and provide timely responses.

### Issue Assignment and Tracking

Your tasks here involve ensuring that issues and pull requests are assigned to appropriate team members for timely resolution.

- **Tasks Involved**: Use labels, milestones, and assignees to categorize and track issues and pull requests.


## Security and Compliance: Quick Guide

Here, your responsibilities are crucial for ensuring both the safety of the code and the legality of its distribution.

### Step 1: Choose and Maintain a License

The tasks involved include selecting an appropriate open-source license and attaching it to your repository. This sets the terms under which others can use, modify, or distribute your code.

```markdown
License > Choose a license > Attach to README or separate LICENSE file
```

### Step 2: Keep Code and Dependencies Up To Date

Regularly update any dependencies and libraries your code relies on to the latest secure versions.

```bash
npm update // Example for Node.js
```

### Step 3: Enable Security Features

GitHub offers automated security features like Dependabot, which scans for known vulnerabilities. Enable this to help mitigate risks.

```markdown
Settings > Security & analysis > Enable Dependabot
```

### Step 4: Audit and Logging

Set up audit logs to keep track of activity within your repository. This is especially crucial for compliance with data protection regulations.

```markdown
Settings > Audit log > Review activities
```

---

By completing these steps, you're contributing to the safety and compliance of your project.



## Maintenance and Monitoring

Here, your responsibilities are centered around ensuring the repository's long-term health and stability. Regular oversight is necessary to maintain code quality, resolve issues, and manage updates.

### Tasks Involved Include:

#### Monitoring:

- **Issue Tracking**: Regularly check for new issues and pull requests. Assign them to appropriate team members and labels.
- **Security Alerts**: Stay vigilant for any security vulnerabilities and act promptly to resolve them.
- **User Activity**: Monitor contributions, forks, and stars as indicators of community engagement.

#### Updates:

- **Dependencies**: Periodically update all project dependencies to their latest stable versions.
- **Code Reviews**: Consistently review any code changes or additions to maintain the code quality.
  
#### Releases:

- **Versioning**: Implement semantic versioning for the codebase and create new releases when needed.
- **Changelogs**: Maintain a changelog that lists the changes made in each new release.

#### Cleanup:

- **Branch Management**: Remove stale or merged branches.
- **Issue Closure**: Close resolved or outdated issues and pull requests.
