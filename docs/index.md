## About our GitHub Account

The SWAT-Model Research Group has created a GitHub account to promote the reproducibility and transparency of our data analysis and research outcomes. Additionally, it provides an open-source avenue for hosting code developed within our group.

## Structure of the Group's account
The [SWAT-Model GitHub](https://github.com/swat-model/) account is structured as an organization with unlimited public and private repositories. A GitHub organization serves as an overarching structure where group members can collaborate and work on repositories. All our group's code is centralized in this space. Individual GitHub accounts can join this organization upon the invitation of one of the owners.

## Access and Permissions
All members are granted read access to both public and private repositories. Moreover, every member has the capability to create new repositories, to which they'll have write access. However, some repositories or branches will have more restrictions than others as needed.

External collaborators can also be added to specific repositories by the repository owners/creators. For any questions or assistance, please contact [@celray](mailto:celrayjames.chawanda@agnet.tamu.edu).
